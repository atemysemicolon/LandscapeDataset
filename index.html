    <p>
      Structured Road scenes are useful for evaluating the performance of an algorithm in
      urban-scenes. This is highly useful for the application of autonomous and assisted driving. However, an algorithm
      or
      a system trained on structured data might not perform so well in unstructured scenarios. Unstructured scenarios
      are
      common for robots or off-road driving, where roads are predominantly non-asphalt. In addition, urban roads often
      have
      lane markings which can be used for automated assistance, but landscape roads do not. Furthermore, there are
      different
      constraints for driving/navigation in unstructured scenarios - Sidewalks may not be present, a goat path may
      intersect
      with an asphalt road, there could be water or small obstacles on the path.

    <p>
      To evaluate against unstructured environments,
      we introduce a new dataset - Bilbao Raw. At the time of writing, there is only one other unstructured dataset
      available -
      Freiburg Raw. We nevertheless introduce another unstructured dataset to further community efforts. Bilbao Raw is
      a sequence of images in an unstructured, non-asphalt road environment, obtained in the country side of Basque
      Country.
      There is one sequence of 1000 images in the dataset, varying through slightly different ambient conditions -
      shadow,
      indirect sunlight and direct sunlight. There are also deformations and obstacles on the road. Each image in the
      dataset
      is 720x360 pixels.
